Finding potential fragment merges with the Fragment Network
This notebook illustrates how to use the Fragment Network to find purchasable molecules that combine parts of two fragments.

For information about the Fragment Network see:

The assumption is that you have 2 fragment screening hits that are partly overlapping in space. You want to identify purchasable
molecules that might be best of both worlds in forming interactions from both fragments.

See the [merge-fragments.ipynb]() notebook for details.
